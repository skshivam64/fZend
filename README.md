Change server default port
--------------------------
Open file `httpd.conf` located in folder : `\udrive\usr\local\apache2\conf`<br>
Locate the lines:
```
  Listen 8088
  ServerName localhost:8088
```
Change to:
```
  Listen 8080
  ServerName localhost:8080

This moves the server to the standard secondary web server port<br>
If port already in use try any value above 2000
